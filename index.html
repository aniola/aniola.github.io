				<p>I live in North Portland.  Major harvests since June include honey mushrooms, tomatoes, potatoes, and apples, crabapples, pears, hazelnuts, and salt.  I volunteer a lot. <!--I do a lot of petsitting.  I'm doing a long-term part-time accounting (for non-profits) internship. -->I bike.  I walk.  Sometimes, I skip.  <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
