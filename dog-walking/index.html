            ##Who
				<p>Hi!  I'm Angel York.  I've been around dogs my whole life, and have done a lot of petsitting over the years.  Dogs, cats, chickens, and assorted small creatures that live in cages & aquariums.  I've been a cat's last petsitter, and a kitten's first.  Dog walking is one of the best parts of my day, so I'd love to walk your dog.</p>
        ##What
        - Dog walking
        - Bike-walking the dog (for dogs who like to go for a jog)
        - Petsitting
        - Housesitting
        - Gardensitting
        ##When
        Openings available starting June 18
        ##Where
        Since I'm hyper-local, I can reach your house no matter the weather.  And I'm always happy to walk in any weather your dog is down for.

        ##Why
        Pay what you can afford.  Standard market prices are $15-30 for a dog walk and $50-115 for overnight (in-home) stays.  However, your pet needs love no matter your budget. 
        ###Note
        This doesn't come up much, but I **will not** walk dogs who ONLY wear a choke collar.  There are more humane options.
